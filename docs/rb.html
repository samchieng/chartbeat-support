<h1>Report Builder</h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
	<p>The Chartbeat Report Builder is designed for analysts and researchers to create and subscribe to custom historical reports about their audience and content. While the Dashboard excels at presenting real-time actionable data, the Report Builder offers the chance to take your data one step further.</p>
	<p>The tool offers a wide array of metrics, filters, and groups that can be used by both analytics and editorial teams to track audience and content data over time. With the Report Builder interface, not only can you elect to receive these reports in your inbox, but you’ll have access to an archive of all the reports you’ve created. It’s easy to copy this data into your own pivot tables to organize your data however you need.</p>
	<p>Get started at <a href="http://chartbeat.com/report/builder">chartbeat.com/report/builder</a>.</p>
<h2>Required Parameters</h2>
	<p><b>Report Type</b></p>
	<p>There are two report types to pick from: a one time report, which creates a single CSV file to be downloaded or sent via email, and a recurring report – which you can subscribe to and receive it in your inbox on a daily, weekly, or monthly basis. Note that daily reports look at the past day of data, weekly reports look at the past week, and monthly look at the past month.</p>
	<p><b>Date Range</b></p>
	<p>The date range specifies time frame you want to pull from for your report. You can select a preset range of the past 7 days, 31 days, the previous 24 hours, or a you can create a custom date range with the calendar box.</p>
	<p><b>Site</b></p>
	<p>The site field is the domain that you want to create a report for. Note that you may only select domains that your Chartbeat login has access to.</p>
<h2>Metrics</h2>
<p>The metrics parameter identifies which audience and site data points you want returned in your report. Any given query may include multiple metrics to create comprehensive reports.</p>
