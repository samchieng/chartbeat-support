				</div>

				<div class="col-md-4">
					<h5>Concurrents</h5>
					<p>This is the number of people who are on your site right now. Rather than totaling up views or visits, we&rsquo;re showing you the size of your audience in real-time. We ping each visitor every few seconds to make sure they're still there and see what actions they've done to indicate engagement.</p>	
				</div>

				<div class="col-md-4">
					<h5>Engaged Time</h5>
					<p>Engaged Time is the average quality time visitors are spending actively interacting with your content. We measure mouse movements, page scrolling, and keystrokes to give you an indication of for how long your visitors are actually consuming your content.</p>
				</div>

				<div class="col-md-4">
					<h5>Recirculation</h5>
					<p>Recirculation is the percentage of your audience that&rsquo;s clicking from an article page to any another page within a single visit. It measures how well traffic is flowing and gauges how well you&rsquo;re succeeding at maintaining the attention of your visitors from page to page.</p>
				</div>

				<div class="col-md-12">
					<p class="captitle">Visitor Frequency</p>
				</div>

				<div class="col-md-4">
					<h5>New Visitors</h5>
					<p>New visitors are the folks in your audience who are on your site for the first time in 30 days. These are the people who might not know your site too well, and are your best bet for making a great impression and encouraging them to come back.</p>	
				</div>

				<div class="col-md-4">
					<h5>Returning Visitors</h5>
					<p>Returning visitors are the people in your audience who have visited more than once in the past month, but less frequently than every other day. This is the group that have some idea of what kind of content you offer, but still need some encouragment before they become &lsquo;loyal&rsquo;.</p>
				</div>

				<div class="col-md-4">
					<h5>Loyal Visitors</h5>
					<p>Loyal visitors are the folks in your audience who have visited your site at least eight of the last 16 days&mdash;about every other day or more. By paying attention to their habits you can understand what keeps them coming back time and time again.</p>

					<div class="col-md-4">
						<h5>Acquiring Badge</h5>
						<p>The &ldquo;acquiring&rdquo; badge appears next to an article that&rsquo;s drawing lots of new visitors. Make sure this page has plenty of engaging content and well-placed links to encourage recirculation.</p>	
					</div>

					<div class="col-md-4">
						<h5>Retaining Badge</h5>
						<p>The &ldquo;retaining&rdquo; badge appears next to an article that has high rcirculation or engaged time&mdash;or both. This is the kind of engaging article that you should push to the biggest audience possible.</p>
					</div>

					<div class="col-md-4">
						<h5>L Badge</h5>
						<p>The &ldquo;L&rdquo; badge will identify a landing page, such as a homepage or section front.</p>

						<h5>Camcorder Icon</h5>

					</div>

					<div class="col-md-4">
						<h5>Chevrons</h5>
						<p>Green and red chevrons tell you about the velocity of an article’s ascent or descent—that is, whether a page is gaining or losing visitors faster than the average page.</p>
					</div>

					<div class="col-md-4">
						<h5>Social Media Badges</h5>
						<p>Social media badges tell you what percent of the current audience came to that page from specific social sources.</p>
