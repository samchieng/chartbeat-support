		<h2>Editorial Dashboard</h2>

		<h3>Concurrents</h3>
		<p>This is the number of people who are on your site right now. Rather than totaling up views or visits, we&rsquo;re showing you the size of your audience in real-time. We ping each visitor every few seconds to make sure they're still there and see what actions they've done to indicate engagement.</p>	

		<h3>Engaged Time</h3>
		<p>Engaged Time is the average quality time visitors are spending actively interacting with your content. We measure mouse movements, page scrolling, and keystrokes to give you an indication of for how long your visitors are actually consuming your content.</p>

		<h3>Recirculation</h3>
		<p>Recirculation is the percentage of your audience that&rsquo;s clicking from an article page to any another page within a single visit. It measures how well traffic is flowing and gauges how well you&rsquo;re succeeding at maintaining the attention of your visitors from page to page.</p>



		<h3>New Visitors</h3>
		<p>New visitors are the folks in your audience who are on your site for the first time in 30 days. These are the people who might not know your site too well, and are your best bet for making a great impression and encouraging them to come back.</p>	

		<h3>Returning Visitors</h3>
		<p>Returning visitors are the people in your audience who have visited more than once in the past month, but less frequently than every other day. This is the group that have some idea of what kind of content you offer, but still need some encouragment before they become &lsquo;loyal&rsquo;.</p>

		<h3>Loyal Visitors</h3>
		<p>Loyal visitors are the folks in your audience who have visited your site at least eight of the last 16 days&mdash;about every other day or more. By paying attention to their habits you can understand what keeps them coming back time and time again.</p>



		<h3>Acquiring Badge</h3>
		<p>The &ldquo;acquiring&rdquo; badge appears next to an article that&rsquo;s drawing lots of new visitors. Make sure this page has plenty of engaging content and well-placed links to encourage recirculation.</p>	

		<h3>Retaining Badge</h3>
		<p>The &ldquo;retaining&rdquo; badge appears next to an article that has high rcirculation or engaged time&mdash;or both. This is the kind of engaging article that you should push to the biggest audience possible.</p>

		<h3>L Badge</h3>
		<p>The &ldquo;L&rdquo; badge will identify a landing page, such as a homepage or section front.</p>

		<h3>Camcorder Icon</h3>
		<p>If you're tracking your video content with the Video Dashboard, the camcorder icon will call out the percentage of visitors currently watching a video on the page.</p>

		<h3>Chevrons</h3>
		<p>Green and red chevrons tell you about the velocity of an article’s ascent or descent—that is, whether a page is gaining or losing visitors faster than the average page.</p>
		
		<h3>Social Media Badges</h3>
		<p>Social media badges tell you what percent of the current audience came to that page from specific social sources.</p>



		<h3>Internal</h3>
		<p>the people who are moving page by page through your website.</p>

		<h3>Direct</h3>
		<p>The people who are visiting any part of your website directly, including your homepage, landing pages, section fronts, and article pages.</p>

		<h3>Social</h3>
		<p>The people who are coming through popular social channels, such as Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest, or Reddit.</p>

		<h3>Search</h3>
		<p>The people who are coming using search engines, such as Google, Bing or Yahoo.</p>

		<h3>Links</h3>
		<p>The people who are visitng through any external link, such as blogs and news sites.</p>



		<h3>High Converting</h3>
		<p>Referrers in this category have great visitor return rates; visitors who come through these referrers tend to come back to your website frequently.</p>

		<h3>Average Converting</h3>
		<p>Referrers in this category have average visitor return rates; some visitors who come through these referrers will come back later, and some won&rsquo;t.</p>

		<h3>Low Converting</h3>
		<p>Referrers in this category have poor visitor return rates; most visitors who come through these referrers will come back once and not return.</p>

		<h3>Inconclusive</h3>
		<p>We don&rsquo;t have eough information yet to classify these referrers.</p>



		<h3>Email, Apps, IMs</h3>
		<p>Also known as &ldquo;Dark Social&rdquo;, this is private social sharing. It contains the traffic that&rsquo;s coming through links in e-mails, thorugh apps, or in instant messages.</p>

		<h3>t.co</h3>
		<p>In short, t.co are URLs from Twitter. To make things super easy for you, we drop any URL starting with t.co into this Twitter referrer category.</p>

		<h3>l.facebook.com &amp; lm.facebook.com</h3>
		<p>&ldquo;l.facebook.com&rdquo; referrs to Facebook&rsquo;s exit/redirect page, also called a &ldquo;web redirector&rdquo;. In some instances, like when you share a link in a direct message, the web redirector is triggered, and Chartbeat will list &ldquo;l.facebook.com&rdquo; as the referrer. The &ldquo;lm.facebook.com&rdquo; is just the mobile version of this. You can read more about Facebook&rsquo;s link shim policy <a href="https://www.facebook.com/notes/facebook-security/link-shim-protecting-the-people-who-use-facebook-from-malicious-urls/10150492832835766">here</a>.</p>
